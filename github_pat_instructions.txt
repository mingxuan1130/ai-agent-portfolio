Alternative Method: Using a Personal Access Token (PAT) for GitHub Authentication

If GitHub Desktop doesn't work for you, you can use a Personal Access Token:

1. Go to GitHub.com and sign in to your account

2. Click on your profile picture in the top right corner, then click "Settings"

3. Scroll down and click on "Developer settings" at the bottom of the left sidebar

4. Click on "Personal access tokens" and then "Tokens (classic)"

5. Click "Generate new token" and then "Generate new token (classic)"

6. Give your token a name (e.g., "Website Push Token")

7. Select the "repo" scope to allow access to your repositories

8. Click "Generate token" at the bottom of the page

9. Copy the generated token (IMPORTANT: You won't be able to see it again!)

10. Open a new PowerShell window and run these commands (replace YOUR_TOKEN with the token you copied):

    cd "C:\Users\mingxuanliu\Desktop\agent project\website"
    $env:PATH += ";C:\Users\mingxuanliu\AppData\Local\GitHubDesktop\app-3.4.17\resources\app\git\cmd"
    git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/mingxuan1130/ai-agent-portfolio.git
    git push origin main

Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username and YOUR_TOKEN with the token you generated.

This method allows you to authenticate with GitHub using a token instead of your password.
